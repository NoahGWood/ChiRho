## License

While ChiRho offers transparency and flexibility through its source availability, it is not open-source in the traditional sense. This means that while developers can view and modify the source code, certain restrictions may apply regarding redistribution, commercial use, and licensing. What does that mean for you?

### For Open Source Developers
If you are developing a free/open-source application on top of the ChiRho framework, you may use any license you want to release your application, and you may statically link and distribute the ChiRho framework libraries with your application, free of charge, but you must provide a copy of the ChiRho framework license.

### For Commercial Use
ChiRho is designed for small, niche developers, and we strive to make commercial use as easy and affordable as possible. Rather than paying for expensive licenses with restrictive NDA's and lots of legal mumbo jumbo, commercial licensees of ChiRho pay a flat royalty on the subscription and license fees collected from the end-user.
